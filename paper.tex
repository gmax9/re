\section{Introduction}

Network telescopes, or darknets, have been instrumental to both researchers and practitioners due to their capacity to observe Internet-wide phenomena in the unsolicited traffic they receive. 
The visibility afforded by these observatories have enabled significant progress in the areas of cybersecurity and censorship, evident in a rich body of work that centers around the study of malicious scanning, denial-of-service attacks, and Internet outages. 
% The visibility afforded by these observatories have enabled significant progress in the areas of cybersecurity and censorship, evident in a rich body of work centered around 
% malicious scanning, denial-of-service events, and Internet outages. 

Over the past two decades, research efforts have shifted from characterizing darknet phenomena and their observable signals towards translating such empirical insights into operationalizable frameworks for monitoring the Internet's security and availability in near real-time.  
This has led to the development of a number of frameworks that each share the common goal of automating the detection of events in darknet traffic while taking notably different approaches to doing so\maxnote{feedback: elaborate on the specifics here.}.
As security risks mount along with growing volumes of darknet traffic, such frameworks represent a crucial and necessary transition from conventional post-hoc manual traffic analysis workflows.
However, the utility of these frameworks, particularly those more recent that leverage machine learning techniques, depend critically on their accuracy and validity which remain elusive to evaluate due to challenges posed by the diversity of framework detection objectives and approaches.

\section{Background}

In this section, we provide a brief overview of network telescopes and findings from prior works that characterize the nature of darknet traffic.

\subsection{Network Telescopes}

% Brief overview of darknets and their traffic (IBR)
Network telescopes, or darknets, consist of IPv4 address space that receive, but do not respond to, unsolicited Internet traffic via routes announced through the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
For decades, researchers have studied this unidirectional traffic to understand its mixtures and origins, attributing its causes to Internet-wide activity ranging from 
malicious scanning~\cite{@@}, residual backscatter from DoS attacks~\cite{@@}, Internet outages~\cite{2011dainotti,2013benson,2015benson,2012dainotti,2021padmanabhan}, and non-trivial network misconfigurations~\cite{@@}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item three types of Internet-wide activity (summarize findings from each of the past major works, characterization of IBR and its changes, major events studied)
\end{enumerate}

Studies of darknet traffic in 2003 by Yegneswaran et al.~\cite{2004yegneswaran} quantified the volume of traffic and distributions of senders responsible for originating malicious scans 
and estimated that 25 billion Internet-wide scans originate per day.

\section{Darknet Event Detection Methodologies}

In this section, we broadly survey existing methodologies that have been proposed to detect various types of darknet events and discuss their commonalities 
while emphasizing their differences that pose a challenge to conducting systematic evaluations. \maxnote{revise the takeaway...}
% In this section, we provide a broad survey of existing frameworks that represent a wide spectrum of techniques proposed to detection various kinds of darknet events.
We structure our survey by categorizing detection methodologies primarily based on the \textit{type of event} (\textit{e.g.,} scanning, backscatter, and outages) 
they aim to detect. Within these categories, we review and emphasize two important aspects for each individual framework: 1) the \textit{classes of general techniques} that encompass their employed algorithms; 
and 2) the \textit{event schema} or unit of detection defined by their authors. 
Here, we briefly discuss these aspects we consider before expounding on individual works.

\vspace{0.25em}
\noindent{\textbf{Activity Type(s)}} refers to the known classes of darknet events that a methodology can capture based on explicitly stated design goals and empirical results in their original works.
Among methodologies that detect multiple types, we find a frequent combination: scanning and backscatter events.
In practice, we can reduce this down to a single type by filtering traffic inputs into framework implementations.
\maxnote{revise this.}

% A common case where a single framework can detect multiple types of events 
% While some frameworks can capture multiple types of events, in practice 
% While in practice these are dependent on traffic inputs, we determine detectable activities for each framework based on explicitly stated design goals and evaluation results.

\vspace{0.25em}
\noindent{\textbf{Event Schema}} refers to attributes represented in the outputs of a given framework.
These attributes derive from packet header fields and implicitly define an instance of a broader type of event.
For example, a framework may define a scanning event using a source-based schema that consists of a timestamp, source IP address, an assigned cluster, and a cluster flag indicating potential malicious intent.

\vspace{0.25em}
\noindent{\textbf{Technique(s)}} differentiate general functionalities that specific algorithms undertake within the scope of each framework.
We identified 7 classes of techniques across our surveyed work which include \textit{dimensionality reduction}, \textit{clustering}, \textit{forecasting}, \textit{thresholding}, \textit{representation learning},
\textit{frequent pattern mining}, and \textit{fingerprinting}. 
To achieve detection objectives, frameworks often combine techniques, \textit{e.g.}, reducing the dimensionality of inputs prior to clustering or 
thresholding as a final-pass, semi-automatic means of filtering outputs before manual validation takes place.

\subsection{Scan Detection Methodologies}

Frameworks designed to detect scanning in darknet traffic typically base their event schemas around either source or destination attributes.
Source-based schemas discern various sender behaviors within incoming traffic to a darknet; in contrast, destination-based schemas emphasize specific targets that incoming traffic directs towards.

\noindent{\textbf{Sourced-based detection}} occurs at a variety of resolutions, ranging from individual and subnetted addresses to the level of autonomous-systems (ASes).
Several of these leverage representation learning combined with clustering at the level of individual source IPs. \maxnote{revise}
Gioacchini et al.~\cite{@@} propose a domain-specific adaptation of Word2Vec that detect anomalous clusters of senders from their arrival order in packet sequences. 
Kallitsis et al.~\cite{@@} used a more comprehensive set of features to train autoencoders, clustering senders in lower-dimensional embedding space.
Both operate at the level of individual source IP addresses. 

Other closely-related frameworks employ dimensionality reduction techniques that rely on linear methods\footnote{while dimensionality reduction can be considered representation learning, we distinguish the two primarily by linearity of the method}.
In a series of works, Han et al.~\cite{@@} separately apply Non-negative Matrix Factorization and Graphical LASSO alongside ad-hoc thresholding techniques to identify coordinated senders.
Kanehara et al.~\cite{@@} apply

\section{Empirical Evaluations of Detection Methodologies}

Here, as a complement to the previous section, we provide a concise overview of empirical evaluations conducted on detection methodologies. 
% Since assessing in-practice performance of any given methodology rests on the results of well-designed, experimental evaluation, 

% The utility of event detection frameworks depend on their performance as demonstrated in well-designed, experimental evaluations. 
% We provide a concise overview of the components of such evaluation found in our surveyed literature by assessing their replicability, 
% characteristics of their datasets, and the coverage of side-by-side framework comparisons.

\noindent{\textbf{Assessing evaluation replicability.}} 
Less than a third of the studies publish accompanying source code of their framework implementation and of those that do, 
we find that their releases are seldom packaged as reusable libraries, distributed through package managers, or maintained beyond initial publication.
This aligns with expectations as the primary goal is to disseminate research ideas rather than deliver production-grade software.
Nonetheless, the condition of the codebases we find often lack interfaces and clear documentation needed for straightforward implementation.

Slightly more than half of the works do, however, provide specifications of the computing environment, \textit{e.g., processor capabilities and memory capacity}, used to run evaluations.
\maxnote{add to significance}

\noindent{\textbf{Dataset characteristics.}}
We find little overlap 
Framework evaluations use darknet traffic sourced from a variety of telescopes over different timeframes.
Traffic volumes differ by multiple orders of magnitude and likely in other metrics as well.
\maxnote{table revision: move annotation}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item different datasets are used to evaluate frameworks
	\item These datasets share different characteristics, evident in their traffic volumes and ostensibly other traffic metrics too since they're sourced from different darknets
	\item Also annotations. 
	\item Which annotations are commonly used as ground truth? Mira. Which works?
	\item Epistemic-soundness is an issue, what's used as approximate ground truth? How valid are these annotations?
	\item When ground-truth isn't available, how is performance evaluated?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent{\textbf{Side-by-side methodology comparisons.}}
Slightly fewer than half of our surveyed works evaluate their proposed methodology against a baseline methodology using the same dataset.
Of those, use of a dataset does not extend beyond an individual work, i.e., real-world traffic datasets are not widely shared for researchers to evaluate their methodologies.



\begin{enumerate}
	\item we can't reasonably compare frameworks by their performance on different datasets.
	\item Few works compare different frameworks on the same dataset
	\item What's the highest number of frameworks that use the same dataset?

\section{Open Challenges and Future Work}

Our survey identifies that while research efforts have been highly productive in generating compelling frameworks for automating darknet event detection, 
critical gaps remain that hinder a comprehensive understanding of their in-practice detection capabilities.

\noindent{\textbf{Curated datasets.}}

Labels applied to a dataset do not necessarily have to be ground truth, e.g., they can be the outputs of other methodologies, but their definitions 
need to be known. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Labels
\end{enumerate}

\noindent{\textbf{Systematic evaluation.}}

Although some individual works from our survey evaluate their methodologies with the same metrics, \textit{e.g.,} TP, FP, \dots, 
the

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Discuss need for standardized evaluation metrics
	\item Discuss need for experimental consistency
	\item These depend on reusability of framework implementations
\end{enumerate}
