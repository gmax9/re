\section{Introduction}

Network telescopes, or darknets, have been instrumental to both researchers and practitioners due to their capacity to observe Internet-wide phenomena in the unsolicited traffic they receive. 
The visibility afforded by these observatories have enabled significant progress in the areas of cybersecurity and censorship, evident in a rich body of work centered around 
malicious scanning, denial-of-service events, and Internet outages. 

Over the past two decades, research efforts have shifted from characterizing darknet phenomena and their observable signals towards translating such empirical insights into operationalizable frameworks for monitoring the Internet's security and availability in near real-time.  
This has led to the development of a number of frameworks, each sharing the common goal of automating event detection within darknet traffic while 
differing with respect to specific\dots

We begin this report with an overview of network telescopes, the traffic they collect, and the types of Internet-wide events inferrable through analysis of such traffic.
We then survey various frameworks that have been proposed to automate event detection and construct a taxonomy that compares their 1) analysis goals and designs; and 2) performance as informed by empirical evaluations on real-world darknet traffic.
Using this taxonomy, we identify challenges and opportunities for future research where efforts may yield improvements over the current state-of-art.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Network Telescopes}

% Brief overview of darknets and their traffic (IBR)
Network telescopes, or darknets, consist of routable portions of IPv4 address space that receive but do not respond to unsolicited Internet traffic. 
Passive collection of this unidirectional traffic has enabled extensive research into various Internet-wide activity ranging from 
malicious scanning~\cite{@@}, residual backscatter from DoS attacks~\cite{@@}, widespread outages~\cite{@@}, and non-trivial network misconfigurations~\cite{@@}.

% Discuss IBR, how it's been analyzed, practical use-cases for security / outage detection

\section{Darknet Event Detection Frameworks}

In this section, we provide a broad survey of existing frameworks that represent a wide spectrum of techniques proposed to detection various kinds of darknet events.
We structure our survey by categorizing detection frameworks primarily based on the \textit{type of event} (\textit{e.g.,} scanning, backscatter, and outages) 
they aim to detect. Within these categories, we review and emphasize two important aspects for each individual framework: 1) the \textit{classes of general techniques} that encompass their employed algorithms; 
and 2) the \textit{event schema} or unit of detection defined by their authors. 
Here, we briefly discuss these aspects we consider before expounding on individual works.

\noindent{\textbf{Activity Type(s)}} refer to the known classes of phenomena that a framework can capture based on explicitly stated design goals and empirical results.
For frameworks that detect multiple types, we find a common combination which includes scanning and backscatter events. 
In practice, we can reduce this down to a single type by filtering traffic inputs into framework implementations.

% A common case where a single framework can detect multiple types of events 
% While some frameworks can capture multiple types of events, in practice 
% While in practice these are dependent on traffic inputs, we determine detectable activities for each framework based on explicitly stated design goals and evaluation results.

\noindent{\textbf{Event Schema}}

\noindent{\textbf{Technique(s)}} differentiate general functionalities that specific algorithms undertake within the scope of each framework to achieve detection objectives. 
We identified 7 classes of techniques across our surveyed work which include \textit{dimensionality reduction}, \textit{clustering}, \textit{forecasting}, \textit{thresholding}, \textit{representation learning},
\textit{frequent pattern mining}, and \textit{fingerprinting}.

% encompass the specific algorithms employed by each framework and differentiate general functions frameworks leverage, often in combination, to

% \textit{frequent pattern mining}, and \textit{fingerprinting}.

\textbf{Algorithm(s)}

\subsection{Scanning}

Frameworks designed to detect scanning events in darknet traffic typically base their unit of detection on either source or destination attributes.
Source-based event schemas enable discernment of different types of sender behavior within incoming traffic to a darknet whereas in contrast, 
destination-based event schemas identify specific targets that incoming traffic is directed towards.

% Enummerate works here
Sourced-based frameworks achieve detection at a variety of resolutions, ranging from individual and subnetted addresses to the level of autonomous-systems (ASes).
Several of these leverage representation learning.
Gioacchini et al.~\cite{2023gioacchini,2021gioacchini} propose a domain-specific adaptation of Word2Vec~\cite{2013mikolov} that detect anomalous clusters of senders from packet arrival sequences.
Kallitsis et al.~\cite{2022kallitsis} trained autoencoders on a more comprehensive set of features and clustered senders using their lower-dimensional embeddings.

% Sourced-based Frameworks
Clustering is a commonly employed technique used to {...}.
When combined with thresholding, frameworks can to some degree automatically identify clusters worthy of assessment.
Several works combine representation learning techniques to {...}.

Han et al. [32, 34 , 35 ] and Kanera
et al. [ 40 ] applied Non-negative Tucker Decomposition (NTD), Non-negative Matrix Factorization
(NMF), and Graphical LASSO (GLASSO) to darknet traffic time series before thresholding ouputs
to identify timeframes of potential coordinated scanning.

On the other hand, destination-based frameworks focus exclusively on detecting target destionation ports.
