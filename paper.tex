\section{Introduction}

Network telescopes, or darknets, have been instrumental to both researchers and practitioners for their ability to observe Internet-wide phenomena in the unsolicited traffic they receive. 
Over the past two decades, research efforts have shifted from characterizing darknet phenomena and their observable signals towards translating such empirical insights into operationalizable methodologies for monitoring the Internet's security and availability in near real-time.
These efforts have culminated in a number of methodologies that, despite sharing a common goal of automatically detecting events from darknet traffic, 
differ widely in the technique(s) they employ (\textit{e.g.,} dimensionality reduction, forecasting, representation learning), features of the traffic they exploit (\textit{e.g.,} packet inter-arrival times, destination port sequences), and their operational definition of what constitutes an event (\textit{e.g.,} a shift in sender clusters, anomalous traffic volumes towards specific ports). 
The diversity represented in these methodologies poses a challenge to assessing their comparative capabilities, which still remain unestablished, in real-world experiments.
As we experienced while designing and evaluating our prior work, DarkSim~\cite{2024gao}, this challenge takes form in limited replicability of implementations, inconsistent approaches to validation, and non-standardized metrics for measuring performance.

We first provide a technical explanation of their function as observatories of unsolicited IPv4 Internet traffic.
We then summarize findings from past works that have studied the nature and composition of this traffic alongside landmark Internet-wide events.
Finally, we remark on changes in darknet traffic characteristics up to the present day and speculate on the future trajectory of its mixtures.

% Brief overview of darknets and their traffic (IBR)
Network telescopes, or darknets, consist of IPv4 address space that receive, but do not respond to, unsolicited Internet traffic via routes announced through the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
For decades, researchers have studied this unidirectional traffic to understand its mixtures and origins, attributing its causes to Internet-wide activity ranging from 
malicious scanning~\cite{2024griffioen,2015dainotti,2017antonakakis,2023bischof,2014durumeric}, 
residual backscatter from DoS attacks~\cite{2014rossow,2017jonker,2017blenn,2021griffioen,2023nawrocki,2024hiesgen}, 
Internet outages~\cite{2011dainotti,2013benson,2012dainotti,2021padmanabhan}, 
and non-trivial network misconfigurations~\cite{2015benson}.

\section{Methodologies for Darknet Event Detection}

In this section, we provide a broad survey of existing methodologies that have been proposed for detecting darknet activities and 
organize prior works into a taxonomy that identifies the need for a systematic evaluation approach to account for the diversity of methods.
We structure our survey by categorizing detection methodologies primarily based on the type of darknet activity they aim to detect. 
Within these categories, we review and emphasize two important aspects of each methodology: 
1) the class(es) of general \textit{techniques} they employ for detection; and 
2) their definition(s) of an \textit{event} belonging under their broader type of targeted activity.
We briefly discuss these aspects before discussing the methodologies that comprise our taxonomy as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:taxonomy}.

Our survey structure consists of a top-level categorization of detection methodologies based on the broad class of (i) darknet activity they aim to detect.
Under these categories, we group similar methods by the (ii) general classes of techniques they employ to achieve their (iii) detection objectives.
Using these groupings, we summarize the intuition behind each method and elaborate on finer-grained details pertaining to their specific (iv) algorithms and (v) traffic features.
Here, we briefly discuss components of the methods we survey.

% We structure our survey by categorizing detection methodologies primarily based on the type of darknet activity they aim to detect. 
% Within these categories, we review and emphasize two important aspects of each methodology: 
% 1) the class(es) of general \textit{techniques} they employ for detection; and 
% 2) their definition(s) of an \textit{event} belonging under their broader type of targeted activity.
% We briefly discuss these aspects before discussing the methodologies that comprise our taxonomy as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:taxonomy}.


\vspace{0.25em}
\noindent{\textbf{Activity Type(s)}} correspond to existing categories of observed activities in darknet traffic as described in Section~\ref{sec:bg:nt}. 
For each study, we identify these type(s) based on explicitly stated goals of each methodology and empirical results from their evaluation. 
Some methods such as~\ref{@@} are capable of detecting multiple types of activities depending on whether their input traffic is filtered.

\vspace{0.25em}
\noindent{\textbf{Event Definitions}} refers to attributes represented in the outputs of a given framework.
These attributes derive from packet header fields and implicitly define an instance of a broader type of event.
For example, a framework may define a scanning event using a source-based schema that consists of a timestamp, source IP address, an assigned cluster, and a cluster flag indicating potential malicious intent.

\vspace{0.25em}
\noindent{\textbf{Technique(s)}} differentiate functionalities that specific \textbf{algorithm(s)} undertake within the scope of each methodology.
We identified 7 classes of techniques across our surveyed work which include \textit{dimensionality reduction}, \textit{clustering}, \textit{forecasting}, \textit{thresholding}, \textit{representation learning},
\textit{frequent pattern mining}, and \textit{fingerprinting}. 
To achieve detection objectives, methodologies frequently combine techniques, \textit{e.g.}, reducing the dimensionality of inputs prior to clustering or 
thresholding as a final-pass, semi-automatic means of filtering outputs before manual validation takes place.

\label{sec:methods:scan}
\subsection{Scan Detection}

A portion of darknet traffic mixtures results from scans that probe the space of Internet addresses, oftentimes targeting application-layer ports.
Detection of these scans involves identifying their sources and targets through analysis of behavioral patterns, thereby enabling further inference and/or classification of their intent.
This section provides a survey of the methodologies proposed for detecting scanning activities in darknet traffic. 

\noindent{\textbf{Sender Classification}}
Gioacchini et al.~\cite{2021gioacchini,2023gioacchini} propose a domain-specific adaptation of Word2Vec to embed senders based on their order of arrival from packet sequences \maxnote{defined over variations of port combinations}.
Kallitsis et al.~\cite{2022kallitsis} include a more comprehensive set of features to train autoencoders and subsequently cluster sender embeddings of a lower-dimensional space. 
Nishikaze et al.~\cite{2015nishikaze} cluster feature vectors that represent source /16 subnets and 27 selected features.
Zakroum et al.~\cite{2023zakroum} 

\vspace{0.25em}
\noindent{\textbf{}}
Han et al.~\cite{2020han,2021han}, Kanehara et al.~\cite{2019kanehara}, and Kartsioukas et al.~\cite{2023kartsioukas} employ classic dimensionality reduction techniques, specifically on time-series representations of darknet traffic, 
alongside ad-hoc thresholding techniques to identify timeframes containing sources of coordinated scanning or targeted services by their ports.
These techniques include algorithms such as Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)~\cite{@@}, Non-negative tucker-decomposition (NTD)~\cite{@@}, and Kartsioukas et al.~\cite{@@}, each of which reduce the space of potential source and destination tuples by filtering for those whose time series possess high reconstruction errors. 
Graphical LASSO~\cite{@@} instead focuses solely on sources by identifying non-trivial correlations in TCP-SYN packet volumes sent by source /16 subnetworks.

\vspace{0.25em}
\noindent{\textbf{}}
Another group of methods employ graph-mining techniques to model scanning behavior.
Evrard et al.~\cite{2019evrard} and Lagraa et al.~\cite{2017lagraa,2019lagraa} represent TCP scan traffic as unipartite graphs, where nodes represent ports and edges represent consecutive port scans, respectively on a global- and individual sender IP-basis. 
To extract similarly probed ports, Evrard et al.~\cite{2019evrard} threshold a shortest-path similarity metric while Lagraa et al.~\cite{2017lagraa} instead threshold node centrality measures, such as degree centrality and betweenness measure, applied to a unified scan-graph.
In follow-up work, Lagraa et al.~\cite{2019lagraa} provide an additional graph definition aimed to detect horizontal scanners by redefining nodes as darknet destination addresses probed on the same port and employ an alternative clustering metric that measures graph modularity.
Soro et al.~\cite{2020soro} define weighted bipartite graphs that link source Autonomous Systems (ASes) to destination ports based on the number of packets in TCP scan traffic that ASes send and extract ASes that target similar sets of ports using the Greedy Modularity Algorithm.


\label{sec:methods:dos}
\subsection{Backscatter Detection}
Several of the previously mentioned methodologies in Section~\ref{@@} detect both scans and backscatter since reflected response traffic generated by spoofed DoS attacks can resemble scanning behavior, e.g., a DoS victim's response to spoofed traffic compared to high-volume horizontal scans.
While distinguishing backscatter from scans in stateful protocol traffic such as TCP, e.g., by inspecting untampered TCP flags, for stateless protocols such as ICMP and UDP it is less so. 
\maxnote{enumerate works here}

\label{sec:methods:outage}
\subsection{Outage Detection}
In contrast to scanning and backscatter detection, outage detection methodologies aim to identify the absence of expected traffic.
These methodologies frame detection in terms of traffic sources defined at varying spatial grains (e.g., per-subnet, per-AS, or per-country) which may depend on darknet-exogenous data for geolocation or AS-organization lookups.

Our survey identifies two works that propose complete outage detection methodologies.
Guillot et al. propose Chocolatine~\cite{2019guillot} which forecasts the expected number of unique senders aggregated at per-AS and per-country granularities by training a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model over historical sender counts of unfiltered, protocol-agnostic traffic inputs; 
sender counts beyond specified 5-minute prediction thresholds are flagged as potential outages.
Enyanet et al. propose Durbin~\cite{2024enyanet} which leverages a Bayesian approach for inferring outages down to a coarser spatial grain of a /24 subnetwork in comparison to Chocolatine. Furthermore, Durbin optimizes parameters per-subnet and and claims to more flexibly exploit space-time precision trade-offs by doing so.

\section{Empirical Assessments of Detection Methodologies}

To demonstrate the utility of their detection methodologies, prior works conduct assessments using real-world darknet traffic datasets.
These assessments and their results provide evidence of a method's performance under realistic settings and offer empirical insights into its detection capabilities and general scalability.
In this section, we characterize prior works along the lines of credibility and reproducibility of their assessments by reviewing:
(i) characteristics of the darknet traffic datasets they use; and
(ii) their approach to validating detection outputs of their methodology.
Furthermore, we consider implementation details of detection methodologies since the reproducibility of assessments and results are closely tied to the availability of method source code and specifications of chosen computational environments.

% \vspace{0.25em}
% \noindent{\textbf{Characteristics of darknet traffic datasets.}}
\subsection{Characteristics of darknet traffic datasets.}
For the datasets used in prior works, we consider several characteristics relevant to interpreting method assessment results:
the timeframe over which traffic was collected, the specific darknet that received this traffic, the size of the darknet's address space, and its traffic volume measured in units of packets and bytes.
Empirical studies such as~\cite{@@} establish that these factors have a non-trivial impact on the observability of darknet traffic (\textit{i.e.,} in terms of traffic composition and visibility of sources).

Across our surveyed works, we identified a total of 7 darknets (listed in Table~\ref{tab:telescopes}) from which datasets source their traffic. 
The amount of IPv4 address space occupied by each darknet varies; the largest and smallest sizes respectively span roughly a /9 (approx. 12.5M addresses comprise the UCSD Network Telescope) 
and three /24 subnetworks (768 addresses operated by Politecnico di Torino). 
While these numbers represent the most up-to-date sizes reported by operators, darknet address space in practice may fluctuate based on ad-hoc announcements 
(e.g., for leasing purposes~\cite{2025mannel} or in the case of more permanent changes such as address ownership transfers~\cite{2019ardc}). 

Shown in Figure~\ref{@@}, the aggregate range of time frames covered by traffic datasets span the start of 2012 and extend until late 2023.
Total coverage over this range by at least a single assessment dataset at a daily granularity sits at 68\%. 
%Recompute
Most datasets are short snapshots: over half of all datasets span fewer than two months, 
roughly a third draw from multi-year darknet traffic, and less than one in five cover three or more years.
The majority of works do not provide clear rationale for their selection of time frames (with some exceptions such as ~\cite{@@} which choose
periods corresponding to specific Internet-wide events) and thus we 
assume that selection is largely opportunistic and based on availability of darknet traffic data from specific darknets when assessments were run.
We conclude that overlaps, shown in Figure~\ref{@@}, between time frames of assessed datasets and major Internet-wide scanning events is incidental, 
and that the detectability of these events by proposed methodologies still remains to be determined.

% Recompute

% Nonetheless, darknet size directly correlates with traffic volumes and ostensibly more variability in its mixtures; thus the generalizability of method performance is sensitive to 
% larger darknets tend to receive greater and more varied traffic~\cite{@@} 

% \vspace{0.25em}
\mybox{Takeaways and Findings}{green!40}{green!10}{

\textbf{Takeaways:} 
Datasets used throughout method assessments possess different levels of observability in their traffic 
due to the variety of darknets and time frames they sample.
Generalizability of a specific method's performance on one dataset to another remains unclear.

% \noindent{\textbf{Validation of detection results.}}
\subsection{Validation of detection results.}

Since limited definitive "ground truth" exists for attributing darknet traffic to their root causes, prior works rely on improvised approaches to validate the meaningfulness of their method outputs.
These approaches differ in rigor depending on two characteristics: 
1) the use of labels (with varying degrees of confidence in their definitions); 
and 2) whether methods are cross-validated against other traffic datasets and/or compared against baseline methods. 
Using these characteristics, we define and group (Table~\ref{tab:eval}) validation approaches into three categories: A1, strictly internal or manual validation; A2; weak external validation; and A3, strong external validation. 

Since limited definitive "ground truth" exists for attributing darknet traffic to their root causes, 
prior works rely on improvised approaches to validate the meaningfulness of their method outputs. 
We evaluate the rigor of these approaches based on their use of labels (whose definitions possess varying degrees of confidence) 
and whether methods are cross-validated against other traffic datasets and/or compared against baseline methods.
Using these characteristics, we define and group (Table~\ref{tab:eval}) validation approaches into three categories.

\begin{comment}
% This yields two broad categories of validation: manual inspection with limited coverage, and systematic validation using external or curated data sources.
% We consider the soundness of method assessments by examining how prior works validate their method's detection outputs in the absence of well-defined ground truth; we identify 3 common approaches.
% In the first approach, authors~\cite{@@} manually inspect detection outputs and interpret their meaning. This non-exhaustive approach to validation serves to illustrate method capabilities in an exploratory manner.
% The second approach extends this process by cross-referencing detection outputs with external datasources, e.g., crowdsourced reports of scanners such as AbuseIPDB~\cite{@@}, \maxnote{enumerate}. Compared to the previous approach, confirmation provided by an additional source can improve confidence in result interpretations.
% The third and most formal approach involves constructing labeled datasets prior to assessment and computing accuracy metrics, e.g., conventional information retrieval metrics such as precision, recall, or F1-score, from subsequently obtained outputs combined with labeled samples. While this approach is the most reproducible, sound comparison of validation results depends on objective definitions for labels.
\end{comment}

\noindent{\textbf{A1 - Strictly Internal/Manual Validation.}}
Approaches that do not utilize ground-truth labels, relying solely on internal clustering metrics or manual inspection of the output.

\noindent{\textbf{A2 - Weak External Validation.}}
Approaches that incorporate external validation but rely on labels with uncertain confidence or lack sufficient cross-comparison 
with other methods.

\noindent{\textbf{A3 - Strong External Validation.}}
The most rigorous approach, employing high-confidence ground-truth labels and validating results 
through extensive cross-comparison with independent datasets or established techniques.

\label{sec:assess:rep}
\subsection{Replicability of detection methodologies.}
To determine the replicability of each detection methodology, we assess whether prior works provide
1) public access to their implementation, such as source code or software artifacts; 
and 2) specifications of the computing environment used to run experiments. 
These two elements are essential for reproducing published results and for applying existing techniques to new traffic datasets. 
We consider a methodology replicable only when both conditions are satisfied.

Less than a third of surveyed works provide source code of their implementations and roughly half detail specifications of their experimental computing environments.
Of readily-available source code, we found Python and R as the programming languages of choice. Both are popular among numeric and scientific communities given their ease-of-use for implementing analytics workflows and abundant open-source algorithmic libraries.
Other works such as ~\cite{2019lagraa,2014bouharb} rely on Java or C, which have become less popular as preferences shift towards higher-languages for analytics use-cases.

Environments used to run experiments range from personal laptop workstations~\cite{@@} to small-scale research compute clusters~\cite{@@}.
Cluster sizes do not exceed five servers, individually equipped with at most 256GB of memory.
Most implementations execute strictly on CPUs while a subset of works that leverage representation-learning techniques employ GPUs for model training and evaluation.
Across our surveyed works, release dates of the CPUs and GPUs trail publication dates by as much as 10 years.

\mybox{Takeaways and Findings}{green!40}{green!10}{

\textbf{Takeaways:} 
    Fewer than a third of the proposed detection methodologies qualify as replicable under our two criteria.
    However, these that do are implemented using widely-adopted programming languages and leverage accessible hardware for experiment execution.

\section{A Need for A Systemized Evaluation of Darknet Event Detection Methodologies}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item From the combined survey of methods and their assessments, we find: a diverse set of available approaches that have yet to be completely compared.
    \item In this section, we drill down into the findings that led to this conclusion and details of these gaps.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent{\textbf{Limited replicability of detection methodologies.}} 
Despite our findings reported in Section~\ref{sec:assess:rep}, we found low reusability for source code released by the small fraction of works. 
Our own atttempts to execute this code resulted in failures, remediated only with substantial modifications. 
While the primary goal of these studies is to demonstrate and disseminate research ideas rather than deliver production-grade software, 
the quality of the code introduces friction for anyone attempting to reproduce results. 
Cumulatively, this effect produces a replicability gap that to address, requires attention and thought to the quality of released software.

\noindent{\textbf{methodology comparisons.}}
Fewer than half of our surveyed works directly compare detection methodologies via evaluations on the same dataset.

% Evaluations that directly compare detection methodologies on the same dataset yield the most definitive results of their relative capabilities.
% Fewer than half of surveyed works fit this criteria 
% Evaluation of detection methodologies by directly comparing their Direct comparisons of detection methodologies yield
% Evaluation of detection methodologies  yield definitive results.
% Slightly fewer than half of our surveyed works evaluate their proposed methodology against a baseline methodology using the same dataset.
% Of those, use of a dataset does not extend beyond an individual work, i.e., real-world traffic datasets are not widely shared for researchers to evaluate their methodologies.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item direct comparisons of detection methodologies by evaluating them on the same dataset is the ideal scenario
    \item Slightly fewer than half of surveyed works fit this criteria
	\item we can't reasonably compare frameworks by their performance on different datasets.
	\item Few works compare different frameworks on the same dataset
	\item What's the highest number of frameworks that use the same dataset?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent{\textbf{Non-overlapping datasets used for experimentation.}}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item little overlap in the datasets used to evaluate frameworks
    % \item evaluation of detection methodologies use darknet traffic sourced from a variety of telescopes over different timeframes
    \item traffic volumes differ by multiple orders of magnitude.
    \item different sources of traffic
    \item mostly non-overlapping timeframes

\section{Future Work}

Our future work intends to bridge the gaps that currently hinder comprehensive assessment of darknet-detection methods. 
In this section, we describe the major components of a future benchmark framework that addresses limitations discussed previously in this report.

\noindent{\textbf{Curated Darknet-Traffic Datasets.}}
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Sound comparisons between methods rely on shared datasets whose characteristics are well-documented.
%     \item Traffic within these datasets that are associated with major events should be labeled.
%     \item Label definitions can be flexible, but there needs to be agreement on their definitions.
%     \item Examples include signatures of scanning tools, scanning organizations based on registered address ranges, or the outputs of previously assessed detection methodologies
%     \item Sound comparisons between methods rely on shared datasets whose characteristics are well-documented.
%     \item Traffic within these datasets that are associated with major events should be labeled.
%     \item Label definitions can be flexible, but there needs to be agreement on their definitions.
%     \item Examples include signatures of scanning tools, scanning organizations based on registered address ranges, or the outputs of previously assessed detection methodologies
% \end{enumerate}
Sound benchmarking practice requires assessing method implementations on shared datasets. 
By providing curated darknet-traffic datasets as inputs to our benchmarking framework, 
we ensure that differences across outputs stem from the methods themselves rather than from inconsistencies in the data.
The curation process involves intentional selection of traffic from specific darknets, sampled over historical time periods, ideally rich with known, landmark events. 
Futher, labels accompany the traffic. \maxnote{elaborate}

\noindent{\textbf{Standardized Assessment Metrics.}}
% \begin{enumerate}
% 	\item Discuss need for standardized evaluation metrics
% 	\item Discuss need for experimental consistency
% 	\item These depend on reusability of framework implementations
% \end{enumerate}
To support expedient comparisons of detection capabilities and computational performance across different methods, our framework 
applies standard metrics to interpret detection outputs.
Owing to a shared set of label definitions, conventional information-retrieval metrics (e.g., true/false positives and negatives) 
quantify detection capabilities on a per-class basis.
Cases where comparative assessments disregard labeled traffic, \textit{i.e.}, comparisons between raw detection outputs are supported 
by differential metrics (e.g., Jaccard Index, etc.), though
